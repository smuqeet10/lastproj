  <h1>Salman Muqeet: Background & Ambitions</h1>
  <h2>Self-Introduction:</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Salman Muqeet and I have lived my entire life in the northwest suburbs of Illinois,
specifically Lombard. As of this semester, I am a fourth year Biomedical Engineering student with a
specilization in Cell and Tissue Engineering. Aside from school, my main passion lies in playing
basketball with my friends. In highschool, I played for my school team for all four years at the
position of shooting gaurd. At the Illinois Institute of Technology I am mainly involved with
twoclubs, MEDLIFE IIT and the Muslim Student Assosciation. In the summer of 2019, I was apart of
MEDLIFE's medical brigade which traveled to Lima, Peru to help in relief efforts in the
suroundingrural villages; here we offered medical, dental and infrastructure support to
the communities. With the MSA, I currently serve as the Vice President and have been involved with
the club since my freshman year when I was the external outreach coordinator.

  <h3>Ambitions in COM330:</h2>
  <p>
    In this class, I hope to learn how to independently create webpages on a small scale. My
previous experience with computer programming was Java, and that did not go as smoothly as expected
so I have been avoiding ccomputers altogether since then. But I thought to myself how before I
graduated I wanted to become somewhat proficient in an area of web design so I decided on taking
this course to do just that. Also, I had previously interned at a tech startup where I worked on
the backend "logic" flow of the website they were developing, which was an application to help
students learn behavioral and social skills by integrating concepts into the school cirriculum.
That was my first real experience with web design and ever since then I have wanted to learn how to
design webpages for my own personal use.

  <h4>Ambitions Post-IIT:</h3>
  <p>
  After college, I hope to work at a biomedical company for a few years before applying to dental
school. Engineering has been a passion of mine since I was a child, and having the opprotunity to
learn it, such a new field was something I hoped not to pass up on and take full advantage of. I
always wanted to learn how to develop my own unique website because I felt as though it was a
necessary skill in the 21st century where websites are the new mode of communication of all sectors
from entertainment, to business, to sports and beyond.
