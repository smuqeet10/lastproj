  <h1>Salman Muqeet:Background & Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    Hey guys! My name is Salman Muqeet and I am currently a 4th year Biomedical Engineering student and will be graduating at the end of this semester. I was born and raised in Lombard, Illinois and attended the College Preparatory School of America from KG till my senior year. I love basketball and played in both middle and high school. At IIT I am involved in the Muslim Student Assosciation where I am the Vice President. I am also apart of MEDLIFE IIT, and was apart of their medical brigade the past summer in Lima, Peru where we provided healthcare essentials to the underprivilidged.

  <h2> Ambitions in COM330</h2>
  <p>
    In this class, I hope to learn how to independently create webpages on a small scale. My previous experience with computer programming was Java, and that did not go as smoothly as expected so I have been avoiding ccomputers altogether since then. But I thought to myself how before I graduated I wanted to become somewhat proficient in an area of web design so I decided on taking this course to do just that. Also, I had previously interned at a tech startup where I worked on the backend "logic" flow of the website they were developing, which was an application to help students learn behavioral and social skills by integrating concepts into the school cirriculum. That was my first real experience with web design and ever since then I always wanted to learn how I could make an impact myself, and I realized web design would be the first step in doing so.

  <h3> Ambitions Post-IIT</h3>
  <p>
  After college, I hope to work at a biomedical company for a few years before applying to dental school. Engineering has been a passion of mine since I was a child, and having the opprotunity to learn it, such a new field was something I hoped not to pass up on and take full advantage of. I always wanted to learn how to develop my own unique website because I felt as though it was a necessary skill in the 21st century where websites are the new mode of communication of all sectors from entertainment, to business, to sports and beyond.
