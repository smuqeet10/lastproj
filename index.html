      <h1> Self-Introduction </h1>
      <p> Hi! My name is Salman and I am a senior at the Illinois Institute of Technology and will
be graduating this May with a degree in Biomedical Engineering. My passion with biomedical
engineering started with my love for biology and math, which led me to explore my career options in
healthcare. Following graduation, I plan to work for an engineering company and hopefully continue
learning more about the biomedical field while gaining experience in research and development.
