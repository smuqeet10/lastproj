  <h1>Salman Muqeet: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    Hey guys! My name is Salman Muqeet and I am currently a 4th year Biomedical Engineering student and will be graduating at the end of this semester. I was born and raised in Lombard, Illinois and attended the College Preparatory School fo America from KG till my senior year. I love basketball and played in both middle and high school. At IIT I am very much involved in the Muslim Student Assosciation where I am the Vice President. I am also apart of MEDLIFE IIT, and was apart of their medical brigade the past summer in Lima, Peru where we provided healthcare essentials to the underprivilidged.

  I can not wait to use the knowledge I learn in this class to develop my own websites because it is a skill I have always wanted to learn but one that I never really was able to learn on my own.

  After college, I hope to work at a biomedical company for a few years before applying to dental school. I always wanted to learn how to develop my own unique website because I felt as though it was a necessary skill in the 21st century where websites are the new mode of communication of all sectors from entertainment, to business, to sports and beyond.
