  <h1>Salman Muqeet: Background and Ambitions</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Salman and I am a fourth year biomedical engineering student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Just some background, I have lived in Illinois all my life and attended a private school for 12 years before joining IIT
  </p>
  <p>
  I can not wait to use the knowledge I learn in this class to develop my own websites because it is a skill I have always wanted to learn but one that I never really was able to learn on my own.
  </p>
  After college, I hope to work at a biomedical company for a few years before applying to dental school. I always wanted to learn how to develop my own unique website because I felt as though it was a necessary skill in the 21st century where websites are the new mode of communication of all sectors from entertainment, to business, to sports and beyond.
